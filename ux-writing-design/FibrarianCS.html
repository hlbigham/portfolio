                    <p>U.S. Army Corp of Engineers is a section of the U.S. Military that strives to improve risk mitigation from natural and man-made disasters and assist civilians after a disaster. </p>
                    <p>This case study was an assignment for my UX Bootcamp where I spent a month redesigning the site based on user reasearch to improve the website’s usability through updating the information architecture.</p>
                    <p><b>My Roles and Responsibilties:</b> User Researcher, Designer, Prototyping and Testing, Information Architecture</p>

                    <p><b>Problem:</b> Confusing and complicated IA along with a cluttered homepage make navigating an information heavy website (usace.army.mil) incredibly difficult.</p>

                        <p>I started by creating a proto-persona, and found it rather difficult because I couldn't think of any reason why someone would end up on the USACE website other than people who work at USACE. In the end, I recalled the last time I was on a government website was when I was doing research for a government job to see if it was something I wanted to apply to. That lead to the creation of KJ.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-7">
                        <p>I conducted three usability tests of the website to figure out the most needed areas of improvement. The results showed that their initial navigation, up to secondary, was understandable. However, when users started to have to dig for information they became confused. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Redline annotations revealed areas of improvement to make a user feel less overwhelmed when they arrive at this website for whatever reason. Improving the information architecture will assist in sorting through the vast amounts of information.</p>
                        <p>After I finished the annotations, I created a moodboard to work through determining the visual design. USACE is part of the military and they already have primary colors for a palette. Incorporating those to ideas, I figured that they would want strong and innovative elements on their website. Keeping in mind their mission statement, I also sought out elements that were demonstrative of cooperation and collaboration.</p>

                            <p>I did not breakdown the entirety of the site's navigation due to the amount found in the navigation; however, some areas were already somewhat grouped (such as the all the Divisions and Districts under location). For those already grouped, I created "general" topics to help decrease the amount of information found in the navigation.</p>
                            <p>The original sitemap on the website was overwhelming and cluttered. Here, I've reduced the navigation to four primary areas, and decluttered the footer. The intention of reducing the amount of options available for a user will decrease any anxiety and frustration a user might feel when navigating the interface.</p>

                            <p>Creating the site navigation forced me to think about not only what was being presented, but how. Originally, I planned on doing a standard vertical drop-down; however, the horizontal drop-down was more efficient and saved on landscape usage.</p>
                            <p>The footer portion of the website proved difficult in determining how to organize the information. I tried to keep links that went off-site together and links relating to military information together, similar with to way social media links are grouped. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Once navigation was finished I added more elements from atomic design to make a more interactive homepage. From my 5-second usability tests, users commented on the cleanliness and professionalism of the design that made it seem more trustworthy.</p>

                            <p>I conducted a usability test for the homepage for 4 individuals and the results didn't lead to massive changes. Most testers found the website visually appealing and easy to navigate. There were comments that the footer didn't feel like it'd be easy to navigate on a phone, so I added spacing and moved items around a bit in that.</p>
                            <p>After finishing the desktop homepage I reconstructed it to fit on a mobile device. The largest challenge I faced was recreating the navigation that was consistent with the overall design. I performed some A/B testing to find the more usable navigation and found that sometimes, familiarity wins out of innovation.

                            <p>Connecting with USACE to find out what the intent behind their website truly is and how it correlates with metrics from the design could propel this project in the right direction for usability. I enjoyed reassessing their information architecture, but the website has so much information on it, a content audit would be necessary prior to implementing any of the changes I've suggested here.
